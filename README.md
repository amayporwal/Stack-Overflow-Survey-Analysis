Stack Overflow Data Analysis 

The Stack Overflow Survey Datasets Analysis Project focuses on exploring and understanding a dataset containing information from over 65,000 respondents, providing valuable insights into various technologies and developer demographics. The analysis combines multiple tools and techniques—Excel for data exploration, SQL for querying, Python for advanced processing and visualization, and Power BI for building interactive dashboards.
Methodology:

•Data Source: The dataset was obtained from the official Stack Overflow Developer Survey, containing responses from over 65,000 developers worldwide. It was provided in CSV format and can be accessed here:

•	Initial Exploration: Microsoft Excel was used for preliminary data exploration to understand the structure, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.

•	SQL Queries: SQL was employed for filtering, aggregating, and joining data to extract relevant subsets and relationships.

•	Data Cleaning & Preparation: Using Python’s pandas and numpy libraries, the data was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Multi-response columns were split and normalized for improved interpretability. Additional Python-based techniques were applied for grouping, correlation checks, and trend identification.

•	Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to produce detailed and insightful visualizations.

•	Interactive Dashboard: A Power BI dashboard was developed to present the findings in a more accessible and interactive format.
